  description: I always wonder why I have to refer to this as just "wood". Sure,
    all it needs to do is let you know this is a basic building material you need
    to collect, but where's the class in that? Why do I have to be so barbaric referring
    to it? If you ask me, I would've called this something like "lignum vitae"! The
    nerve of some game devs...
