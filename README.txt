Second Playtest
March 1, 2023

=Objective=
The player has the ability to design their own zoo. As the ticket booth accumulates money, the player will have the option to visit empty spots and place animals, decorations, restaurants, shops, and attractions. This game is open-ended, so the player decides how large they want to expand their zoo. 

=Controls=
Player 1: 
WASD - movement (forward-sideways)
X - open menu
Z - cycle left
C - cycle right

Player 2:
IJKL - movement (forward-sideways)
COMMA - open menu
M - cycle left
PERIOD - cycle right


=Bugs=
-The visitor occasionally jitters if it hits a corner of a pen. We believe this was fixed, but it may occur.
-The visitor also may appear to "float" due to jagged parts of the NavMesh pushing it off the ground.
