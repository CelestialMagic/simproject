=Objective=
The player has the ability to design their own zoo. As the ticket booth accumulates money, the player will have the option to visit empty spots and place animals, decorations, restaurants, shops, and attractions. This game is open-ended, so the player decides how large they want to expand their zoo. For the first playtest, the player can build up to 9 exhibits.
